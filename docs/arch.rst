    | Your host running |                || Zigbee Gateway || )))     ((( || Zigbee device #1 ||
    |   pyzigbee        | --- HW bus --- ||                ||               ------------------
    --------------------                  ------------------                     ...

                                                                           --------------------
                                                                      ((( || Zigbee device #N ||
                                                                           --------------------

The HW (hardware) bus can be a serial line, a SPI line,... or whatever depending on the zigbee gateway. The same way, the protocol used to talk with this gateway over the HW bus can vary.


Some more details
-----------------

To reflect reality, the library has the following classes:

  * Drivers: deal with low level communication with the underlying hardware
  * Protocols: deal with encoding and decoding frames for given protocols
  * Gateways: relying on Drivers and Protocols, they provide an API to talk to Zigbee devices

The UML diagram should look like:

                    |_______________|   |______________|


.. note::

  The *dummy* classes are used for testing

The client code (application side) only relies on Gateway objects which are created by the library.
